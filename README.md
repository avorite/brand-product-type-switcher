## 📦 Installation

For detailed installation instructions, see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

### Quick Installation

**Manual Installation:**
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Upload the `brand-product-type-switcher` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Navigate to **WooCommerce → Brand Type Switcher** in the admin menu

**Via Git:**
```bash
cd wp-content/plugins
git clone https://github.com/avorite/brand-product-type-switcher.git
```

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Navigate to Admin Page**
   - Go to **WooCommerce → Brand Type Switcher** in your WordPress admin

2. **Select Brands**
   - Check the brands you want to modify
   - Use "Select All" to select all brands at once
   - Each brand shows the number of products it contains

3. **Choose Product Type**
   - Select from the dropdown:
     - **Simple (Purchasable)**: Regular purchasable products
     - **External/Affiliate Product**: External/affiliate products

4. **Start Processing**
   - Click "Save Changes" button
   - Watch the progress bar and logs in real-time
   - The process runs in batches with automatic delays

5. **Review Results**
   - Check the statistics (Success/Errors)
   - Review the detailed logs
   - Processing completes automatically

## 🔧 How It Works

### Product Type Switching

When switching product types:
- **Simple → External**: Product URL is preserved if it exists
- **External → Simple**: Product URL is saved before switching and can be restored later
- **Same Type**: Products already of the target type are skipped

### Batch Processing

- Processes 5 products at a time
- 500ms delay between batches
- Prevents server overload on large product catalogs
- Real-time progress updates

### Session Management

- Each processing session is tracked with a unique ID
- Session data stored in WordPress options table
- Progress can be monitored via AJAX polling
